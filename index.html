                How did Emmanuel Akinjogunla, who had applied to study medicine at the University of Benin just last year, become someone who is going above and beyond to become a "tech bro"? What's his story?

                <h2>How it started</h2>
                <p>       
                    Emmanuel grew up in Olodi Apapa, Lagos State, and was a science department student in high school. He was initially driven by a desire to make people feel better, especially when they weren't feeling well. So he applied to the University of Benin to study medicine (Uniben). But medicine, his initial dream, was not his only interest. "I had seen the backend of a website by accident while my sister was inspecting one, and I was fascinated by it." I was curious about how this gibberish became this lovely website."

                    After writing JAMB and Post-UTME for Uniben, Emmanuel decided to explore web development while awaiting the admission list. With the help of his sister, he signed up for free courses online at (course name) and (course name) and started learning

                <p>
                    After waiting months for the admission list and being fully immersed in his training, particularly FreeCodeCam, Emmanuel's passion for software development was indescribable; he knew he wanted to do this.

                <p>
                    So he stopped checking the JAMB portal for his name. Instead, he signed up for boot camps for full-stack development and applied for the next JAMB to study computer science.

                    "I understand that being a full stack developer is not an easy journey, especially because I'm combining two aspects (frontend and backend); however, after seeing the possibilities, I'm willing to go down this path."

                <p>
                    Emmanuel is a quick learner who is enthusiastic about software development. He has spent the last six months studying and training to become a full-stack developer. He is determined to invest his time and utilize all accessible resources to get better every day. He is currently pursuing a degree in computer science at Elizade University.

                <p>
                    He aspires to greatness and will achieve it through God's grace and hard work, refusing to be limited by his surroundings or other external factors. He enjoys meeting new people, so he can learn from them and assist them when they have difficulty with their work.
